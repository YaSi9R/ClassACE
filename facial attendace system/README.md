## Project Overview

The Facial Attendance System is designed to simplify and automate the process of attendance management in educational institutions or corporate environments. By leveraging facial recognition technology, this system ensures accurate and efficient attendance tracking, reducing manual errors and enhancing security.

## Features

- **Face Detection and Recognition**: Uses OpenCV and `face_recognition` to detect and recognize faces from a live camera feed or uploaded images.
- **Automated Attendance**: Automatically marks attendance by matching recognized faces with the database of known faces.
- **Firebase Integration**: Stores images and attendance data securely in Firebase.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Sends alerts and notifications for specific events, such as unauthorized access.
- **Behavior Monitoring**: Tracks and monitors student or employee behavior patterns based on attendance data.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Uses historical data to predict future attendance trends.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **face_recognition** (Dlib)
- **Firebase**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **cvzone**
- **CSV for local storage**

## Usage

- Start the system: Run the main.py file to start the attendance system.

-Capture Faces: Use the system to capture faces from a live feed or upload images for attendance marking.

-View Attendance Records: Attendance records will be updated in the local CSV file and can also be viewed in Firebase.
